# Creating a Workspace {#workspace}

Now that you have an account that works with AnVIL, you are ready to get started! In this chapter, we will learn about **Workspaces**, the fundamental work units inside AnVIL. Once you have created a Workspace, you can launch many tools and explore datasets. We will use a Workspace to launch [RStudio](#rstudio) in the next chapter.

On AnVIL, you use Workspaces to configure and run analyses and share results. Workspaces support interactive analysis with RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor and Galaxy. Workspaces can also save the output generated by running an analysis with a Workspace’s associated “cloud environment.” Check out [https://anvilproject.org](https://anvilproject.org) to learn more about everything you can do within a Workspace.
