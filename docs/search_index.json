All activities will be run using RStudio, so if you choose, you can use a different RStudio interface (such as RStudio Cloud or locally installed RStudio). The Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) is a scalable and interoperable computing resource for the genomics scientific community. AnVIL enables researchers to analyze high-value open and controlled access genomic datasets with popular analysis tools in a secure cloud computing environment. AnVIL also serves as a data commons. It runs on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is sponsored by NHGRI. In addition to Docker-based analysis workflows, AnVIL supports popular interactive analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor, RStudio, and Galaxy. By operating in the cloud, AnVIL users can scale analyses from a single computer to thousands and securely share data, workflows, and reproducible results with collaborators and colleagues. 2.2 Create a Google Account AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll need a Google account to make sure your instructor can keep track of any computing costs you accrue. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 2.3 Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra with your Google account to allow your instructor to add you to projects and/or Workspaces associated with your specific class. This is the only way you can launch applications and perform computations on AnVIL. Launch Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. 2.4 Share your ID It is very important that you share the Google account you used above with your instructor! Otherwise, they cannot add you to class projects or Workspaces. "],["workspace.html", "Chapter 3 Creating a Workspace", " Chapter 3 Creating a Workspace Now that you have an account that works with AnVIL, you are ready to get started! In this chapter, we will learn about Workspaces, the fundamental work units inside AnVIL. Once you have created a Workspace, you can launch many tools and explore datasets. We will use a Workspace to launch RStudio in the next chapter. On AnVIL, you use Workspaces to configure and run analyses and share results. Workspaces support interactive analysis with RStudio, Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor and Galaxy. Workspaces can also save the output generated by running an analysis with a Workspace’s associated “cloud environment.” Check out https://anvilproject.org to learn more about everything you can do within a Workspace. Launch Terra on AnVIL In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Workspaces”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click “Workspaces”. Click on the plus icon near the top of left of the page. Name your Workspace and select the Billing Project as indicated by your instructor. Do not change the Bucket Location or Authorization Domain. You can add a Description if you wish. Click “CREATE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces. "],["rstudio.html", "Chapter 4 Working in RStudio 4.1 Launch RStudio Cloud Environment 4.2 Tour RStudio 4.3 More Practice with iSEE 4.4 Pause RStudio 4.5 Delete RStudio Cloud Environment 4.6 Video Guide", " Chapter 4 Working in RStudio Now that you have created a Workspace, you can create an RStudio cloud environment. This will allow you to interface with data and perform genomics-based analyses with add on packages from the Bioconductor community. 4.1 Launch RStudio Cloud Environment Click on the name of the Workspace you just created. You should be routed to a link that looks like: https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces/&lt;billing-project&gt;/&lt;workspace-name&gt;. On the top right, Click the gear icon to access your Cloud Environment options. You will see a list of costs because it costs a small amount of money to use cloud computing. Click “CUSTOMIZE”. Click on the first drop down menu to see what other software configurations are available. Scroll down and select RStudio from the Community-Maintained RStudio Environments section. NOTE: AnVIL is very versatile and can scale up to use very powerful cloud computers. It’s very important that you select the cloud computing environment described here to avoid runaway costs. Leave everything else as-is. To create your RStudio Cloud Environment, click on the “CREATE” button. Your Cloud Environment will be available in a few minutes after the cloud resources are provisioned and your software starts up. The upper right corner displays the status and should say “Creating” while resources are being provisioned. After a few minutes, you will see the status change to “Running”. Click on the “R” icon to launch RStudio. You should now see the RStudio interface with information about the version printed to the console. 4.2 Tour RStudio Next, we will be using RStudio and the package Glimma to create interactive plots. See this vignette for more information. The Bioconductor team has created a very useful package to programmatically interact with Terra and Google Cloud. Install the AnVIL package. It will make some steps easier as we go along. BiocManager::install(&quot;AnVIL&quot;) You can now quickly install precompiled binaries using the AnVIL package’s install() function. We will use it to install the Glimma package and the airway package. The airway package contains a SummarizedExperiment data class. This data describes an RNA-Seq experiment on four human airway smooth muscle cell lines treated with dexamethasone. We will learn more about SummarizedExperiments in following chapters. AnVIL::install(c(&quot;Glimma&quot;, &quot;airway&quot;)) Load the example data. library(airway) data(airway) The multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot is frequently used to explore differences in samples. When this data is MDS transformed, the first two dimensions explain the greatest variance between samples, and the amount of variance decreases monotonically with increasing dimension. The following code will launch a new window where you can interact with the MDS plot. Glimma::glimmaMDS(assay(airway), group = colData(airway)$dex) Change the colour_by setting to “groups” so you can easily distinguish between groups. In this data, the “group” is the treatment. You can download the interactive html file by clicking on “Save As”. You can also download plots and other files created directly in RStudio. To download the following plot, click on “Export” and save in your preferred format to the default directory. This saves the file in your cloud environment. limma::plotMDS(airway) You should see the plot in the “Files” pane. Select this file and click “More” &gt; “Export” Select “Download” to save the file to your local machine. 4.3 More Practice with iSEE iSEE is a Bioconductor package that provides an interactive Shiny-based graphical user interface for exploring data stored in SummarizedExperiment objects (Rue-Albrecht et al. 2018). Run the following. # Install iSEE AnVIL::install(&quot;iSEE&quot;) # Launch app on airway data iSEE::iSEE(airway) The Shiny app will allow you to explore genes and samples. 4.4 Pause RStudio The upper right corner reminds you that you are accruing cloud computing costs. You should minimize charges when you are not performing an analysis. You can do this by clicking on “Stop cloud environment”. This will release the CPU and memory resources for other people to use. Note that your work will be saved in the environment and continue to accrue a very small cost. Your instructor can delete these environments to stop costs accruing, so it’s a good idea to save code or output somewhere else, such as GitHub or your local machine. 4.5 Delete RStudio Cloud Environment Stopping your cloud environment only pauses your work. When you are ready to delete the cloud environment, click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to “Update cloud environment”. Click on “Delete Environment Options”. If you are certain that you do not need the data and configuration on your disk, you should select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. Select “DELETE”. 4.6 Video Guide In addition to the steps above, you can review this video guide on how to launch RStudio on AnVIL.

These data classes are built with genomics data in mind. This makes data compatible with different packages and/or methods. It also makes data easier to manipulate. The SummarizedExperiment class is used to store rectangular matrices of experimental results, which are commonly produced by sequencing and microarray experiments. Each SummarizedExperiment stores observations of one or more samples, along with additional meta-data describing both the observations (features) and samples (phenotypes). A key aspect of the SummarizedExperiment class is the coordination of the meta-data and assays when subsetting. For example, if you want to exclude a given sample you can do for both the meta-data and assay in one operation, which ensures the meta-data and observed data will remain in sync. Improperly accounting for meta and observational data has resulted in a number of incorrect results and retractions so this is a very desirable property. SummarizedExperiment is a matrix-like container where rows represent features of interest (e.g. genes, transcripts, exons, etc.) and columns represent samples. The objects contain one or more assays, each represented by a matrix-like object of numeric or other mode. The rows of a SummarizedExperiment object represent features of interest. Information about these features is stored in a DataFrame object, accessible using the function rowData(). Each row of the DataFrame provides information on the feature in the corresponding row of the SummarizedExperiment object. Columns of the DataFrame represent different attributes of the features of interest, e.g., gene or transcript IDs, etc. The above information comes directly from the vignette for SummarizedExperiment. Please check out their page for more information. 5.2 Exploring SummarizedExperiment First, we will load the necessary packages. # Install and load airway # AnVIL::install(c(&quot;airway&quot;)) library(airway) Load the gene expression data.

It has long been established in the biomedical literature that the level of agreement between correlated variables can be usefully examined by plotting differences versus means.

These raw counts range from very small to quite large numbers! 6.2 Plotting Raw Counts Let’s say we want to compare treated and untreated samples. We will first look at the sample data. # View metadata colData(airway) ## DataFrame with 8 rows and 9 columns ## SampleName cell dex albut Run avgLength ## &lt;factor&gt; &lt;factor&gt; &lt;factor&gt; &lt;factor&gt; &lt;factor&gt; &lt;integer&gt; ## SRR1039508 GSM1275862 N61311 untrt untrt SRR1039508 126 ## SRR1039509 GSM1275863 N61311 trt untrt SRR1039509 126 ## SRR1039512 GSM1275866 N052611 untrt untrt SRR1039512 126 ## SRR1039513 GSM1275867 N052611 trt untrt SRR1039513 87 ## SRR1039516 GSM1275870 N080611 untrt untrt SRR1039516 120 ## SRR1039517 GSM1275871 N080611 trt untrt SRR1039517 126 ## SRR1039520 GSM1275874 N061011 untrt untrt SRR1039520 101 ## SRR1039521 GSM1275875 N061011 trt untrt SRR1039521 98 ## Experiment Sample BioSample ## &lt;factor&gt; &lt;factor&gt; &lt;factor&gt; ## SRR1039508 SRX384345 SRS508568 SAMN02422669 ## SRR1039509 SRX384346 SRS508567 SAMN02422675 ## SRR1039512 SRX384349 SRS508571 SAMN02422678 ## SRR1039513 SRX384350 SRS508572 SAMN02422670 ## SRR1039516 SRX384353 SRS508575 SAMN02422682 ## SRR1039517 SRX384354 SRS508576 SAMN02422673 ## SRR1039520 SRX384357 SRS508579 SAMN02422683 ## SRR1039521 SRX384358 SRS508580 SAMN02422677 We will manually take the mean across treated and untreated samples. # Collect the counts and sample data raw_counts &lt;- assay(airway) sample_data &lt;- colData(airway) # Select untreated samples untrt_sample_means &lt;- rowMeans2(raw_counts[, sample_data$dex == &quot;untrt&quot;]) # Select treated samples trt_sample_means &lt;- rowMeans2(raw_counts[, sample_data$dex == &quot;trt&quot;]) Then we will plot the two groups. plot(untrt_sample_means, trt_sample_means) This is hard to interpret. Most of the genes are clustered in the bottom left corner. 6.3 Transforming (\\(\\log_{2}\\)) Using a \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformation makes it easier to examine all the genes together. # Plot with log2 transformation plot(log2(untrt_sample_means), log2(trt_sample_means)) 6.4 Using Fold-Change to Create an MA Plot As stated at the very start of this chapter, plotting differences versus means can be very helpful when many genes are correlated. It also makes interpretation easier when combined with a \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformation. In the next steps, you will create a preliminary MA plot. MA plots are a widely used way to visualize genomic data. The M represents the difference between two conditions (fold-change), while the A represents the average intensity of the expression. Both values take on a \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformation. M is expressed as a log ratio or difference in the following form. M is almost always placed on the y-axis. \\[M = log_{2}(\\frac{condition 1}{condition 2}) = log_{2}(condition 1) - log_{2}(condition2)\\] A is more simple, taking the form of a transformed average. A is often called “log mean expression” and is almost always placed on the x-axis. \\[A = \\frac{1}{2} (log_{2}(condition 1) + log_{2}(condition 2))\\] When untreated and treated expression are equal, fold-change is equal to zero. log2(10) - log2(10) ## [1] 0 When untreated expression is greater, fold-change is positive. log2(20) - log2(10) ## [1] 1 log2(100) - log2(1) ## [1] 6.643856 However when treated expression is greater, fold-change is negative. log2(10) - log2(20) ## [1] -1 log2(1) - log2(100) ## [1] -6.643856 Calculate log2 fold-change and mean expression for the data. log2_fold_change &lt;- log2(untrt_sample_means) - log2(trt_sample_means) mean_expression &lt;- (log2(untrt_sample_means) + log2(trt_sample_means)) / 2 Plot the values above, with mean expression on the x-axis and fold-change on the y-axis. plot(mean_expression, log2_fold_change) Since there are many data points, it’s a good idea to customize your plot. The ggplot2 package can also provide greater flexibility with plotting. library(scales) ## Warning: package &#39;scales&#39; was built under R version 4.0.3 plot(mean_expression, log2_fold_change, col = alpha(&quot;black&quot;, 0.1), pch = 16, cex = 0.5) This gives us a very rough idea of how transformation and using fold-change can aid in interpretation of the data. In reality, we need to cover a few more steps before creating this kind of plot. 6.5 Future Directions A simple MA plot can be produced with the plotMA() function from the limma package. Other packages for exploring differential gene expression in R, such as DESeq2, also have functions to create MA plots. # Not run plotMA() glimmaMA() from the Glimma package creates interactive MA plots. # Not run glimmaMA() 6.6 Recap sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] parallel stats4 stats graphics grDevices utils datasets ## [8] methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] scales_1.1.1 airway_1.10.0 ## [3] SummarizedExperiment_1.20.0 Biobase_2.50.0 ## [5] GenomicRanges_1.42.0 GenomeInfoDb_1.26.7 ## [7] IRanges_2.24.1 S4Vectors_0.28.1 ## [9] BiocGenerics_0.36.1 MatrixGenerics_1.2.1 ## [11] matrixStats_0.61.0 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] compiler_4.0.2 BiocManager_1.30.10 jquerylib_0.1.4 ## [4] highr_0.8 XVector_0.30.0 bitops_1.0-7 ## [7] tools_4.0.2 zlibbioc_1.36.0 digest_0.6.25 ## [10] evaluate_0.14 lifecycle_1.0.0 lattice_0.20-41 ## [13] rlang_0.4.10 Matrix_1.2-18 DelayedArray_0.16.3 ## [16] yaml_2.2.1 xfun_0.26 GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.4 ## [19] stringr_1.4.0 knitr_1.33 grid_4.0.2 ## [22] R6_2.4.1 rmarkdown_2.10 bookdown_0.24 ## [25] farver_2.0.3 magrittr_2.0.2 htmltools_0.5.0 ## [28] colorspace_1.4-1 stringi_1.5.3 munsell_0.5.0 ## [31] RCurl_1.98-1.2 References "],["design-matrices.html", "Chapter 7 Design Matrices 7.1 Overview 7.2 Types of Models 7.3 Making a Design Matrix 7.4 More Complex Designs 7.5 Recap", " Chapter 7 Design Matrices 7.1 Overview When performing differential expression analysis on genomic data (such as RNA-seq experiments), scientists usually use linear models to determine the direction (did expression go up or down?) and magnitude (by how much?) of the change in expression. These scientists are interested in understanding the relationship between gene expression (the “response” variable”) and variables that affect expression, such as a treatment or cell type (“explanatory variable(s)”). Design matrices are fundamental concepts in mathematics, statistics, and other domains, but their application to genomic data can introduce some complexity. See this Bioconductor vignette for an excellent, in-depth look at design matrices. 7.2 Types of Models The type of explanatory variables in our experiment will determine what our model looks like. 7.2.1 Regression: Continuous Variables Continuous variables, or covariates, are numeric. This means that we could create a scatterplot comparing the covariate and expression. We could then imagine drawing a best fit line through those points to create our model. Law et al. (2020) state: [Covariates] can be the age or weight of an individual, or other molecular or cellular phenotypes on a sample… For covariates, it is generally of interest to know the rate of change between the response and the covariate, such as “how much does the expression of a particular gene increase/decrease per unit increase in age?”. We can use a straight line to model, or describe, this relationship, which takes the form of \\[Expression = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}age\\] where the line is defined by \\(\\beta_{0}\\) the y-intercept and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) the slope. In this model, the age covariate takes continuous, numerical values such as 0.8, 1.3, 2.0, 5.6, and so on. These \\(\\beta\\) values are known as parameters and are important for determining the impact of explanatory variables on expression. 7.2.2 Means: Categorical Variables Categorical variables are discrete variables, or factors. We can think of these variables as “bins” that our samples fall into. Law et al. (2020) state: [Factors] are often separated into those that are of a biological nature (e.g. disease status, genotype, treatment, cell-type) and those that are of a technical nature (e.g. experiment time, sample batch, handling technician, sequencing lane). Unique values within a factor are referred to as levels. For example, genotype as a factor may contain two levels, “wildtype” and “mutant”. Here, it is generally of interest to determine the expected or mean gene expression for each state or level of the factor. The relationship between gene expression and the factor can be described, or modeled, in the form of \\[Expression = \\beta_{1}wildtype + \\beta_{2}mutant\\] where \\(\\beta_{1}\\) represents the mean gene expression for wildtype, and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) represents the mean gene expression for mutant. The “genotype” factor in this model is not numeric like “age” above, so the calculations work a bit differently. For any given sample, it can be either wildtype or mutant but not both. So, the values “wildtype” and “mutant” can only be zero (no) or one (yes). When a sample is mutant, “wildtype” = 0, and \\(\\beta_{1}\\) drops out of the equation. Likewise, when a sample is wildtype, “mutant” = 0, and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) drops out of the equation. This kind of model is called a means model. 7.2.3 Mean-Reference: Categorical Variables You can also design categorical models with a “reference” value for comparison. Law et al. (2020) state: An alternative parameterisation of the means model directly calculates the gene expression difference between mutant and wildtype. It does so by using one of the levels as a reference. Such a model is parameterised for the mean expression of the reference level (e.g. wildtype), and the rest of the levels are parameterised relative to the reference (e.g. the difference between mutant and wildtype). The relationship between gene expression and genotype is modeled in the form of \\[Expression = \\beta_{1} + \\beta_{2}mutant\\] where \\(\\beta_{1}\\) represents the mean gene expression for wildtype, and \\(\\beta_{2}\\) is the difference between means of mutant and wildtype This kind of model can be really useful if you are interested in the difference between groups rather than the estimated parameters for the groups themselves. This kind of model is called a mean-reference model. 7.3 Making a Design Matrix Law et al. (2020) use the following data to demonstrate how you might build a design matrix. This is a very simple example - in reality, we’d have many more genes being expressed. df ## expression mouse age group ## 1 2.38 MOUSE1 1 HEALTHY ## 2 2.85 MOUSE2 2 HEALTHY ## 3 3.60 MOUSE3 3 HEALTHY ## 4 4.06 MOUSE4 4 SICK ## 5 4.61 MOUSE5 5 SICK ## 6 5.04 MOUSE6 6 SICK 7.3.1 Regression: Continuous Variables Use the model.matrix() function to create the design matrix with the continuous variable “age”. model.matrix( ~ df$age) ## (Intercept) df$age ## 1 1 1 ## 2 1 2 ## 3 1 3 ## 4 1 4 ## 5 1 5 ## 6 1 6 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 0 1 ## Installing package into &#39;/usr/local/lib/R/site-library&#39; ## (as &#39;lib&#39; is unspecified) You can remove the intercept by adding zero to the design matrix. This forces the y-intercept to be zero. You could also use a different number here. model.matrix( ~ 0 + df$age) ## df$age ## 1 1 ## 2 2 ## 3 3 ## 4 4 ## 5 5 ## 6 6 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 1 7.3.2 Means: Categorical Variables Use the model.matrix() function to create the design matrix with the factor “group”. To create a means model, you should include a zero in the model. model.matrix( ~ 0 + df$group) ## df$groupHEALTHY df$groupSICK ## 1 1 0 ## 2 1 0 ## 3 1 0 ## 4 0 1 ## 5 0 1 ## 6 0 1 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 1 1 ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$`df$group` ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; Notice that you only see zeros and ones for the two groups: df$groupHEALTHY and df$groupSICK. 7.3.3 Mean-Reference: Categorical Variables Simply remove the zero to use a mean-reference model. model.matrix( ~ df$group) ## (Intercept) df$groupSICK ## 1 1 0 ## 2 1 0 ## 3 1 0 ## 4 1 1 ## 5 1 1 ## 6 1 1 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 0 1 ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$`df$group` ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; Notice how there is now an intercept. Remember that the parameter will now represent the difference between the groups instead of the second group mean. 7.4 More Complex Designs model.matrix() can easily handle more complex experimental designs. df2 ## expression mouse group type ## 1 2.38 MOUSE1 HEALTHY WILDTYPE ## 2 2.85 MOUSE2 HEALTHY WILDTYPE ## 3 3.60 MOUSE3 HEALTHY WILDTYPE ## 4 4.06 MOUSE4 SICK WILDTYPE ## 5 4.61 MOUSE5 SICK WILDTYPE ## 6 5.04 MOUSE6 SICK WILDTYPE ## 7 6.48 MOUSE7 HEALTHY MUTANT ## 8 6.70 MOUSE8 HEALTHY MUTANT ## 9 8.01 MOUSE9 HEALTHY MUTANT ## 10 11.99 MOUSE10 SICK MUTANT ## 11 12.81 MOUSE11 SICK MUTANT ## 12 14.73 MOUSE12 SICK MUTANT The following will create a design matrix for “group” and “type”. model.matrix( ~ df2$group + df2$type) ## (Intercept) df2$groupSICK df2$typeWILDTYPE ## 1 1 0 1 ## 2 1 0 1 ## 3 1 0 1 ## 4 1 1 1 ## 5 1 1 1 ## 6 1 1 1 ## 7 1 0 0 ## 8 1 0 0 ## 9 1 0 0 ## 10 1 1 0 ## 11 1 1 0 ## 12 1 1 0 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 0 1 2 ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$`df2$group` ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; ## ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$`df2$type` ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; Use the “*” to create a design matrix for the “group” and “type” as well as their interaction. model.matrix( ~ df2$group + df2$type) ## (Intercept) df2$groupSICK df2$typeWILDTYPE ## 1 1 0 1 ## 2 1 0 1 ## 3 1 0 1 ## 4 1 1 1 ## 5 1 1 1 ## 6 1 1 1 ## 7 1 0 0 ## 8 1 0 0 ## 9 1 0 0 ## 10 1 1 0 ## 11 1 1 0 ## 12 1 1 0 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 0 1 2 ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$`df2$group` ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; ## ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$`df2$type` ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; 7.5 Recap sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] ggplot2_3.3.2 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] pillar_1.4.6 compiler_4.0.2 jquerylib_0.1.4 highr_0.8 ## [5] tools_4.0.2 digest_0.6.25 lattice_0.20-41 nlme_3.1-148 ## [9] evaluate_0.14 lifecycle_1.0.0 tibble_3.0.3 gtable_0.3.0 ## [13] mgcv_1.8-31 pkgconfig_2.0.3 png_0.1-7 rlang_0.4.10 ## [17] Matrix_1.2-18 curl_4.3 yaml_2.2.1 xfun_0.26 ## [21] withr_2.3.0 httr_1.4.2 stringr_1.4.0 dplyr_1.0.2 ## [25] knitr_1.33 generics_0.0.2 fs_1.5.0 vctrs_0.3.4 ## [29] hms_0.5.3 grid_4.0.2 tidyselect_1.1.0 glue_1.6.1 ## [33] R6_2.4.1 ottrpal_0.1.2 rmarkdown_2.10 bookdown_0.24 ## [37] farver_2.0.3 readr_1.4.0 purrr_0.3.4 magrittr_2.0.2 ## [41] splines_4.0.2 scales_1.1.1 ellipsis_0.3.1 htmltools_0.5.0 ## [45] colorspace_1.4-1 labeling_0.3 stringi_1.5.3 munsell_0.5.0 ## [49] crayon_1.3.4 References "],["help.html", "A Help", " A Help We welcome any and all questions at our Discourse Channel.
