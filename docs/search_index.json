All activities will be run using RStudio, so if you choose, you can use a different RStudio interface (such as RStudio Cloud or locally installed RStudio). The Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) is a scalable and interoperable computing resource for the genomics scientific community. AnVIL enables researchers to analyze high-value open and controlled access genomic datasets with popular analysis tools in a secure cloud computing environment. AnVIL also serves as a data commons. It runs on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is sponsored by NHGRI. In addition to Docker-based analysis workflows, AnVIL supports popular interactive analysis tools such as Jupyter notebooks, Bioconductor, RStudio, and Galaxy. By operating in the cloud, AnVIL users can scale analyses from a single computer to thousands and securely share data, workflows, and reproducible results with collaborators and colleagues. 3.2 Step 1: Create a Google Account AnVIL uses Terra to run analyses. Terra operates on Google Cloud Platform, so you’ll need a Google account to make sure your instructor can keep track of any computing costs you accrue. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. Otherwise, please use a Gmail account you have already set up. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 3.3 Step 2: Sign in to Terra You need to sign into Terra with your Google account to allow your instructor to add you to projects and/or Workspaces associated with your specific class. This is the only way you can launch applications and perform computations on AnVIL. Launch Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. You can always access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio, or by clicking the link on the AnVIL home page. 3.4 Step 3: Share your ID It is very important that you share the Google account you used above with your instructor! Otherwise, they cannot add you to class projects or Workspaces.

(2015) : Measuring expression in multiple RNA samples produces columns of correlated expression values, which are highly correlated because they are measured on the same set of genes or genomic features. It has long been established in the biomedical literature that the level of agreement between correlated variables can be usefully examined by plotting differences versus means. In other words, gene expression data is full of correlations. We must think carefully about how we examine and plot gene expression data. In the next steps, we will: Examine how \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformations and fold-change improve data clarity Learn how to make MA plots on gene expression data Much of the following has been adopted from the Glimma vignette for limma and edgeR (Su et al. 2017). 4.2 Gene Expression Data First, we will load the necessary packages. # Install and load Glimma, limma, and matrixStats # BiocManager::install(c(&quot;Glimma&quot;, &quot;limma&quot;)) library(Glimma) library(limma) library(matrixStats) Load the gene expression data. We will be using data from Sheridan et al. (2015) that has already been vetted to demo plot creation. This experiment consists of three cell populations - basal, luminal progenitor (LP) and mature luminal (ML) - sorted from mice mammary glands. Each treatment consists of three replicates. The gene expression data is stored in a special list-based data class called a “DGEList” (this stands for Digital Gene Expression). # Load the gene expression data dge &lt;- readRDS(system.file(&quot;RNAseq123/dge.rds&quot;, package = &quot;Glimma&quot;)) head(dge$counts,10) ## 10_6_5_11 9_6_5_11 purep53 JMS8-2 JMS8-3 JMS8-4 JMS8-5 JMS9-P7c JMS9-P8c ## 497097 1 2 342 526 3 3 535 2 0 ## 20671 1 1 76 40 33 14 98 18 8 ## 27395 431 771 1368 1268 1564 769 818 468 342 ## 18777 768 1722 2517 1923 3865 1888 1830 1246 693 ## 21399 810 977 2472 1870 2251 1716 1932 756 619 ## 58175 452 358 17 14 622 571 12 203 224 ## 108664 1716 2678 2097 2071 5499 3630 1731 1715 1251 ## 12421 3451 2699 3399 2716 5233 6280 3647 1866 2122 ## 319263 2026 2033 3920 2715 3873 3688 3593 1609 1348 ## 59014 956 985 5497 4214 3462 2933 5336 649 731 In this data, each sample is in a column, while each gene is in a row. These raw counts range from very small to quite large numbers! 4.3 Plotting Raw Counts Let’s say we want to compare basal and LP samples. We will first look at the metadata. # View metadata dge$samples ## files group lib.size norm.factors lane ## 10_6_5_11 GSM1545535_10_6_5_11.txt LP 32857304 0.8943956 L004 ## 9_6_5_11 GSM1545536_9_6_5_11.txt ML 35328624 1.0250186 L004 ## purep53 GSM1545538_purep53.txt Basal 57147943 1.0459005 L004 ## JMS8-2 GSM1545539_JMS8-2.txt Basal 51356800 1.0458455 L006 ## JMS8-3 GSM1545540_JMS8-3.txt ML 75782871 1.0162707 L006 ## JMS8-4 GSM1545541_JMS8-4.txt LP 60506774 0.9217132 L006 ## JMS8-5 GSM1545542_JMS8-5.txt Basal 55073018 0.9961959 L006 ## JMS9-P7c GSM1545544_JMS9-P7c.txt ML 21305254 1.0861026 L008 ## JMS9-P8c GSM1545545_JMS9-P8c.txt LP 19955335 0.9839203 L008 We will manually take the mean across basal samples and LP samples. # Collect the counts raw_counts &lt;- dge$counts # Basal samples are columns 3, 4, and 7 basal_sample_means &lt;- rowMeans2(raw_counts[, c(3, 4, 7)]) # LP samples are columns 1, 6, and 9 LP_sample_means &lt;- rowMeans2(raw_counts[, c(1, 6, 9)]) Then we will plot the two groups. plot(basal_sample_means, LP_sample_means) This is hard to interpret. Most of the genes are clustered in the bottom left corner. 4.4 Transforming (\\(\\log_{2}\\)) Using a \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformation makes it easier to examine all the genes together. # Plot with log2 transformation plot(log2(basal_sample_means), log2(LP_sample_means)) 4.5 Using Fold-Change As stated at the very start of this chapter, plotting differences versus means can be very helpful when many genes are correlated. It also makes interpretation easier when combined with a \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformation. When basal and LP expression are equal, fold-change is equal to zero. log2(10) - log2(10) ## [1] 0 When basal expression is greater, fold-change is positive. log2(20) - log2(10) ## [1] 1 log2(100) - log2(1) ## [1] 6.643856 However when LP expression is greater, fold-change is negative. log2(10) - log2(20) ## [1] -1 log2(1) - log2(100) ## [1] -6.643856 Calculate fold-change for the data. log2_fold_change &lt;- log2(basal_sample_means) - log2(LP_sample_means) mean_expression &lt;- (log2(basal_sample_means) + log2(LP_sample_means)) / 2 Plot the values above, with mean expression on the x-axis and fold-change on the y-axis. plot(mean_expression, log2_fold_change) This gives us a very rough idea of how transformation and using fold-change can aid in interpretation of the data. In reality, we need to cover a few more steps before creating this kind of plot. 4.6 About MA Plots In the previous steps, you created a preliminary MA plot. MA plots are a widely used way to visualize genomic data. As you experienced above, these plots are a specific type of scatterplot typically used for gene expression datasets. The M represents the difference between two conditions (fold-change), while the A represents the average intensity of the expression. Both values take on a \\(\\log_{2}\\) transformation. M is expressed as a log ratio or difference in the following form. M is almost always placed on the y-axis. \\[M = log_{2}(\\frac{condition 1}{condition 2}) = log_{2}(condition 1) - log_{2}(condition2)\\] A is more simple, taking the form of a transformed average. A is often called “log mean expression” and is almost always placed on the x-axis. \\[A = \\frac{1}{2} (log_{2}(condition 1) + log_{2}(condition 2))\\] In the next steps, we will go over how to create an MA plot using limma. First, we will need to supply the design matrix and contrast matrix. 4.6.1 The Design Matrix Load the design matrix. This indicates which samples correspond to which cell populations. # Load the experimental design matrix design &lt;- readRDS( system.file(&quot;RNAseq123/design.rds&quot;, package = &quot;Glimma&quot;)) design ## Basal LP ML laneL006 laneL008 ## 1 0 1 0 0 0 ## 2 0 0 1 0 0 ## 3 1 0 0 0 0 ## 4 1 0 0 1 0 ## 5 0 0 1 1 0 ## 6 0 1 0 1 0 ## 7 1 0 0 1 0 ## 8 0 0 1 0 1 ## 9 0 1 0 0 1 ## attr(,&quot;assign&quot;) ## [1] 1 1 1 2 2 ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;) ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$group ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; ## ## attr(,&quot;contrasts&quot;)$lane ## [1] &quot;contr.treatment&quot; 4.6.2 The Contrast Matrix Load the contrast matrix. This indicates which cell populations we want to compare. contr.matrix &lt;- readRDS( system.file(&quot;RNAseq123/contr.matrix.rds&quot;, package = &quot;Glimma&quot;)) 4.6.3 Fitting the Data There are several more steps to normalize and fit the data before making an MA plot. Don’t worry! We will cover these steps in more detail later in the course. Briefly, the voom() function \\(\\log_{2}\\) transforms and normalizes the data. lmFit() fits a linear model for each gene to examine differential expression between the cell populations we want to compare. v &lt;- voom(dge, design) vfit &lt;- lmFit(v, design) vfit &lt;- contrasts.fit(vfit, contrasts = contr.matrix) 4.7 Creating an MA Plot A simple MA plot can be produced with the plotMA() function. Other packages for exploring differential gene expression in R, such as DESeq2, also have functions to create MA plots. plotMA(vfit) 4.8 Interactive MA Plots glimmaMA() from the Glimma package creates interactive MA plots. Again, don’t worry about the preparation steps - these will be covered in more detail later. eBayes() computes statistics by empirical Bayes moderation of the standard errors towards a global value. efit &lt;- eBayes(vfit) glimmaMA(efit, dge = dge) 4.9 Recap sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.2 (2020-06-22) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS/LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas-pthread/libopenblasp-r0.3.8.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_US.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=C ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## other attached packages: ## [1] matrixStats_0.61.0 limma_3.46.0 Glimma_2.0.0 ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] MatrixGenerics_1.2.1 Biobase_2.50.0 ## [3] httr_1.4.2 edgeR_3.32.1 ## [5] jsonlite_1.7.1 bit64_4.0.5 ## [7] splines_4.0.2 highr_0.8 ## [9] BiocManager_1.30.10 stats4_4.0.2 ## [11] blob_1.2.1 GenomeInfoDbData_1.2.4 ## [13] yaml_2.2.1 pillar_1.4.6 ## [15] RSQLite_2.2.1 lattice_0.20-41 ## [17] glue_1.6.1 digest_0.6.25 ## [19] GenomicRanges_1.42.0 RColorBrewer_1.1-2 ## [21] XVector_0.30.0 colorspace_1.4-1 ## [23] htmltools_0.5.0 Matrix_1.2-18 ## [25] DESeq2_1.30.1 XML_3.99-0.5 ## [27] pkgconfig_2.0.3 genefilter_1.72.1 ## [29] bookdown_0.24 zlibbioc_1.36.0 ## [31] purrr_0.3.4 xtable_1.8-4 ## [33] scales_1.1.1 BiocParallel_1.24.1 ## [35] tibble_3.0.3 annotate_1.68.0 ## [37] generics_0.0.2 IRanges_2.24.1 ## [39] ggplot2_3.3.2 ellipsis_0.3.1 ## [41] SummarizedExperiment_1.20.0 BiocGenerics_0.36.1 ## [43] survival_3.1-12 magrittr_2.0.2 ## [45] crayon_1.3.4 memoise_1.1.0 ## [47] evaluate_0.14 tools_4.0.2 ## [49] lifecycle_1.0.0 stringr_1.4.0 ## [51] S4Vectors_0.28.1 munsell_0.5.0 ## [53] locfit_1.5-9.4 DelayedArray_0.16.3 ## [55] AnnotationDbi_1.52.0 compiler_4.0.2 ## [57] jquerylib_0.1.4 GenomeInfoDb_1.26.7 ## [59] rlang_0.4.10 grid_4.0.2 ## [61] RCurl_1.98-1.2 htmlwidgets_1.5.2 ## [63] bitops_1.0-7 rmarkdown_2.10 ## [65] gtable_0.3.0 DBI_1.1.0 ## [67] R6_2.4.1 knitr_1.33 ## [69] dplyr_1.0.2 bit_4.0.4 ## [71] stringi_1.5.3 parallel_4.0.2 ## [73] Rcpp_1.0.8 vctrs_0.3.4 ## [75] geneplotter_1.68.0 tidyselect_1.1.0 ## [77] xfun_0.26 References "],["help.html", "A Help", " A Help We welcome any and all questions at our Discourse Channel.
